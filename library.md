In the public recipe  you can search for recipes shared by other Brewfather users. Located as a new page called "Library" in the menu.

To share your recipes in the library there is now a new "padlock" icon in the recipe designer. Clicking this you can toggle the recipe to be publicly available.

All users can view and download recipes. Upload \(and voting\) of recipes are for Premium users only.

Text search can be used to search for all the visible text fields, inlcuding recipe name, style, tags, profile name. More filtering options will come later as the library grows.

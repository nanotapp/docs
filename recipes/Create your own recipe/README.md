# Create your own recipe

### Introduction

There are several definitions of what a good recipe is, but according to John J. Palmer [^footnote] a good recipe is:

> "*that is has the right proportion of ingridients to provide both complexity and balance of flavors. A typical recipe will consist of a majority of a pale "base" malt, with addition speciality malts for signature flavors or accents, and enough hops to provide a balance of bitterness, flavor, and aroma to the beer. It is also importen to realize that great recipe will not overcome poor brewing techniques and a good recipe does not need to be complicated.*"

The foollowing chapters will guide your through a short course in how to research, design and then brew your beer from Brewfather.
